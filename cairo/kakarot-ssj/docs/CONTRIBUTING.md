# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository
before making a change. Please note we have a
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions
with the project.

## Contributing guidelines

Kakarot is an open-source project and we welcome contributions of all kinds.
However, we ask that you follow these guidelines when contributing:

- If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, please create an issue
  first. This will allow us to discuss the idea and provide feedback before you
  start working on it.
- If you are working on an issue, please ask to be assigned. This will help us
  keep track of who is working on what and avoid duplicated work.
- Do not ask to be assigned to an issue if you are not planning to work on it
  immediately. We want to keep the project backlog clean and organized. If you
  are interested in working on an issue, please comment on the issue and we will
  assign it to you. We will remove the assignment if you do not start working on
  the issue within 2 days. You can, of course, submit a draft PR if you need
  more time or have questions regarding the issue.
- Prefer rebasing over merging when updating your PR. This will keep the commit
  history clean and make it easier to review your changes.
- Adopt
  [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  This will help us when reviewing your PR.

## Prerequisites

To set up a development environment, please follow the steps from
[the README.md](../README.md#installation). Make sure that your Scarb version
matches the one expected, specified in the [.tool-versions](../.tool-versions)
file.

## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe
you'd like a new feature?Take a look at
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sayajin-labs/kakarot-ssj/discussions) to
see if it's already being discussed. You can help us by
[submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sayajin-labs/kakarot-ssj/issues).
Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue
may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what
  environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**

### How to submit a Pull Request

1. Search our repository for open or closed
   [Pull Requests](https://github.com/sayajin-labs/kakarot-ssj/pulls) that
   relate to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Fork the project
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing_feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing_feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feat/amazing_feature`)
6. [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/sayajin-labs/kakarot-ssj/compare?expand=1)

### Migrating from Cairo Zero to Cairo

Kakarot SSJ is a rewrite of
[Kakarot Zero](https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot), an implementation of the
Ethereum Virtual Machine in Cairo Zero. As such, most logic has already been
written. As part of the migration path, this business logic will be either
ported and translated as is or improved.

Here is a quick checklist when building on Kakarot SSJ and taking on issues.

#### Working on Opcodes

When working on opcodes, make sure to check several things:

- The issue's specs, always start with the issue.
- The
  [Ethereum yellow paper's](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)
  paragraph for the issue, there is a non-zero probability that the early
  implementation missed a specific edge case.
- The [EVM playground](https://www.evm.codes/) to be able to read the specs and
  play around directly on the [playground](https://www.evm.codes/playground).
- The [Cairo Zero implementation](https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot) that
  already exists in the above-mentioned repo.

Now, here are things to pay attention to:

- The types: we **should avoid using felt252 type as much as possible**. In some
  cases, enums, structs and trait might be a good idea to write more idiomatic
  Cairo.
- The tests: we need extensive testing. Unit tests and integration tests.
- The gas: we need our code to be lean. When possible, test different ways to
  implement the same feature and argue which one is least gas expensive. But be
  careful, _first make it work, then make it fast_. No need to over-engineer and
  prematurely optimise.

#### Working on utils

When working on test utils, script & practical helpers, remember to:

- Check if the util is still relevant, a lot of new features make Cairo very
  powerful and make old utils obsolete.
- Check if the utility function can be refactored into a trait for a specific
  type, e.g. as
  [per this PR](https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot-ssj/pull/74/files#diff-888cfc6a9147d3727c6f8c083b5d0890ed686240e5dc4da1a741e025bdbd81f7R282)
- Check if the type is still relevant, don't forget: we **should avoid using
  felt252 type as much as possible** and **use unsigned integers as much as
  possible**.

#### Working on data structures

Kakarot has many data structures, e.g. an Ethereum Transaction (struct), a Stack
(Cairo dict), a Memory (Cairo dict), etc. When porting over the data structures,
pay attention:

- Should it be a struct?
- Should it be an enum: this is a new type made available in Cairo.
- Which types to use? Remember! **use unsigned integers as much as possible**.
- Remember to add traits for specific types instead of utils to write Cairo (&
  Rust) idiomatic code.
- Test everything! Even small traits for specific types.
